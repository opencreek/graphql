# Fork Update Instructions

All changes are part of the following branches:

```
wherecypher-auth-directive
ogm-auth
disable-relay-checks
fix-date-serialization
add-update-instructions-to-readme
```

1. Update main branch of this repo with a release tag from upstream (the best way to find the latest release is to look at the github releases and take the last release of a sub-package, e.g. `@opencreek/neo4j-graphql@3.16.0`)

```bash
git fetch
git switch main
git merge $LATEST_RELEASE
```

2. Rebase the branches above on the updated main branch

```bash
git switch wherecypher-auth-directive
git rebase main

git switch ogm-auth
git rebase main

git switch disable-relay-checks
git rebase main

git switch fix-date-serialization
git rebase main

git switch add-update-instructions-to-readme
git rebase main
```

3. Delete the fork branch and create a new, clean fork branch

```bash
git switch main
git branch -D fork
git switch -c fork
```

4. Merge the branches above into the fork branch

```bash
git merge wherecypher-auth-directive
git merge ogm-auth
git merge disable-relay-checks
git merge fix-date-serialization
git merge add-update-instructions-to-readme
```

5. Update all package references from `@neo4j-graphl` to `@opencreek/neo4j-graphl`

```bash
rg -g '!examples' -g '!docs' -g '!*.md' -g '!yarn.lock' -l -0 "@neo4j/graphql" | xargs -0 sed -i 's,@neo4j/graphql,@opencreek/neo4j-graphql,g'
```

6. Bump the `packages/graphql` version in `package.json`, build and publish it

```bash
cd packages/graphql
yarn build
# Suffix the current version with -oc.<num>, so for the first
# oc release on this version use -oc.1
npm version --workspaces-update=false $NEW_VERSION
npm publish --access=public
```

7. Bump the `packages/ogm` version and its dependencies in `package.json`, build and publish it

```bash
cd packages/ogm
yarn add @opencreek/neo4j-graphql@$NEW_VERSION
yarn build
# Suffix the current version with -oc.<num>, so for the first
# oc release on this version use -oc.1
npm version --workspaces-update=false $NEW_VERSION
npm publish --access=public
```

8. Done!
